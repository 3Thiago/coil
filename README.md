# Coil

Coilcoin is a primitive (**incomplete**) Python-based cryptocurrency intended for educational purposes.

## Pending Tasks
The following tasks must be completed before Coil is a fully functioning cryptocurrency.

* Merkle Tree Implementation (algorithm)
* Concensus Algorithm
* Wallets stored in session
* Mining Tool
* Wallet signed transactions

## Contributing
I am looking to build a small community to develop coil further. If you're interested in contributing servers,
code or just ideas, why not join the gitter community.
