# Coil

Coilcoin is a primitive (**incomplete**) Python-based cryptocurrency intended for educational purposes.

## Pending Tasks
The following tasks must be completed before Coil is a fully functioning cryptocurrency.

* Merkle Tree Implementation (algorithm)
* Concensus Algorithm
* Wallets stored in session
* Mining Tool
* Wallet signed transactions

## Getting Started
To initialize a node, run the python script...
```bash
python coil.py
```

Next, go in to `coil.py` and uncomment like 23, and then comment lines 19 & 20. These lines are only available to the creator, who has the `wallet.pem` file (mainly for testing purposes).

## Dependencies
* Python 3.6 (only tested with Ubuntu 17.10)
* aiohttp
* requests

## Contributing
I am looking to build a small community to develop coil further. If you're interested in contributing servers,
code or just ideas, why not join the gitter community.
