Mon 08 Jan 2018 ====================================
Just thought that since it may be a while until I
can get back to development of the project, I should
note down some major/minor changes that need to be
implemented into the core.

[ Bugs ]
* Corrupt signature *according to error sytem, when
  processing new transactions / mining blocks
* Wallet on reload, appends coinbase to history
  multiple times (atleast in session)
  
[ Wider issues ]
* Concensus - testing needed
* Verifying coinbase transactions
* https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/41911/how-do-nodes-verify-that-a-block-has-been-solved-and-can-be-added-to-the-blockch

[ Changes ]
* Encode public keys
